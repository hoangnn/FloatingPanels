Usage

This is not meant to be an easy drop-in replacement for anything.
Please try to read the entire source code and understand the whole project.

No memory management was implemented yet.


Disclaimers

I do not own any of the images in the Assets folder.
They are simple random wallpapers I pulled from the Internet and resize them for demo purposes.
