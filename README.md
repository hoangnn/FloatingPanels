Floating Panels
=============

This is a quick demo I cooked up in 1 day to mimic the floating gallery behavior of the famous Android's FloatingImage.

Usage
-------

This is not meant to be an easy drop-in replacement for anything.
Please try to read the entire source code and understand the whole project.

No memory management was implemented yet.


Screenshot & Video
-------

screenshot.png above shows the Facebook Connect feature in the app.

A demo video is available from YouTube here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmJ__xxdbFc
This video was taken when Facebook Connect feature had yet been added.


Disclaimers
------------

I do not own any of the images in the Assets folder.
They are simple random wallpapers I pulled from the Internet and resize them for demo purposes.
